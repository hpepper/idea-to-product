# TODO

* Generate Context Diagram table
* For the Deployment viewpacket use 'Contains' to describe the subgraph thingy.
  * I guess I have to have some memory of the first Contains, so that I only creat the subgraph the first time I see this contains op.
* Add support for layers rendering.
* generate the allocation mode
* add relation description to ComponentRelation
* Be able to limit the level in the primary display.
